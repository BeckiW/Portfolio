        I have always had a passion for tech and solving problems with technology. In my PhD and research career I used software to build small solutions and analyse data. Now I am focussing on Javascript and with the Technigo program I will complete 480 hours of coding, 50+ individual projects with HTML5, CSS, SASS, Javascript (ES6), React, Node
        and MongoDB and 6 sprints and group projects with companies such as Volumental, Bonnier, Comprend and Svenska Spel all within 3 months.
