The app was designed for Svenska Spel around their Gräsroten scheme, so you can choose (and change) the sports team you want to play for using their internal API and then record your exercise hours to gain points for that team. There is also a gamification page where you get badges for different levels of points/exercise you complete. It utilises Novi's data visualisation library for the statistics page as I wanted to dig deeper into Data Visualisation with D3 type libraries, so a lot of data manipulation was involved.",
